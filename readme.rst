SchoolTracker is a framework that monitors and dispatches notifications on the changing statuses of schools that are part of the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District (NLESD). It is what powers the Twitter bot, `NLESD School Status <https://twitter.com/nlschoolstatus>`_

This project is not intended for use by normal users. If you would like to work on bringing a new method for delivering notifications to this project, feel free to fork this project and submit a pull request.
